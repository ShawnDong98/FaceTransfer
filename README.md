# FaceTransfer

# Introduce

It's a pytorch implement of Deepfake.

This repo is for academic learning.

 if you want to a perfect and easy to use software, see here [DeepFaceLab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab).

# What have I done 

:white_check_mark: A architecture of VAE-GAN

:white_check_mark: Spectral Normalization(SNGAN)

:white_check_mark: Self-Attention Mechanism(SAGAN)

:x: Progressive Growing Architecture(PGGAN) (I discard this idea, because there is no need to build a progressive growing architecture for a ralative low resolution such as 128, 256, while it makes training process complex)


# To do list

:white_large_square: Style-Based Generator Architecture(StyleGAN)

:white_large_square: SPADE Block(GauGAN)
